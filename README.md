# Task 3: A/B Hypothesis Testing

## Overview
This project conducts A/B hypothesis testing to evaluate the impact of specific features on key performance indicators (KPIs).

## Key Performance Indicators
- Conversion Rate
- Average Profit Margin

## Data Segmentation
- **Group A (Control Group)**: Plans without the feature.
- **Group B (Test Group)**: Plans with the feature.

## Statistical Testing
- Conducted t-tests for numerical KPIs.
- Conducted chi-squared tests for categorical data.

## Results
- T-test results indicated insufficient data for analysis.
- Chi-squared test showed a significant difference in gender distribution between groups.

## Conclusion
The findings suggest that the feature being tested may have different effects based on gender distribution. Further analysis may be needed to explore alternative KPIs or additional features.
